#Data Structures
##    Primary   
-        1. Strings
            methods:
                replace() //is a function
                length //is an object
                dataType.toString() converts any dataType to a string
                split() // Converts string to array.  inside paranthesis goes what character to split at
-        2. Numbers
-        3. Arrays (also an abject )
-        4. Objects
